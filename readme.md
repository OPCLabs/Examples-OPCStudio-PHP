This directory contains examples for OPC client ans subscriber development in PHP.The examples cover OPC Data Access 
(OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) specifications, including OPC UA 
PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows.

The examples can be run
* on the Web server, or
* standalone (in the console).

The examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC "Classic" servers for Windows
are installed using the [OPC Studio Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).
